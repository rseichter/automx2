2019.0 (2019-12-13): First public release.

2020.0 (2020-01-24): Introduce LDAP support to map email addresses to login IDs.

2020.1 (2020-03-08): Support "werkzeug" release 1.0.0.

2020.2 (2020-12-16): Introduce support for POP3 servers.

2021.0 (2021-01-09): Improve handling of login name placeholders in Outlook generator.

2021.1 (2021-02-23): Fix LDAP attribute processing when using Active Directory backends.

2021.2 (2021-03-07): Change XML root element namespace in Outlook generator.

2021.3.1 (2021-04-02): Support additional mixed-case route in Outlook generator. Support CalDAV/CardDAV for eM Client.

2021.4 (2021-04-20): Bugfix: "SSL" element now depends on socket_type DB column. Drop "AuthRequired" XML element from
  Autodiscover response because automx2 always returned "on", which is the default value if the element is absent.

2021.5 (2021-10-04): Existing versions auf automx2 return "do not use SSL" for socket types other than SSL and STARTTLS.
  This previously undocumented behaviour can cause unexpected results. Future automx2 versions will terminate automx2
  when encountering invalid socket type strings in the database. The current release logs an error to notify users of
  the upcoming change.
  This release also improves the Mobileconfig generator, making it smarter when choosing among multiple servers defined
  in the database.

2021.6 (2021-12-17): Introduce "Encryption" element (see MS-OXDSCLI v20210817) in Autodiscover generator to better
  support server connections which require the use of STARTTLS.

2022.0 (2022-03-31): Simplified database initialisation is now possible via HTTP POST and a JSON payload.

2022.1 (2022-05-20): Request content type verification now works if additional parameters like "charset" are passed.

2024.0 (2024-02-19): Remove redundant Flask initialisation call in unit tests. This call caused errors when running
  the test suite with recent versions of SQLAlchemy.
  Introduce PEP 517 compliant build.

2024.1 (2024-02-21): Fix unit tests packaging problem.
  Bundle documentation for offline use.
  Permit network tests to be enabled/disabled on demand.

2024.2 (2024-08-01): Fix: Interpret STARTTLS as "uses SSL" in mobileconfig.
  Feature: Support CalDAV and CardDAV in mobileconfig.
  Feature: Support passwords in mobileconfig (disabled by default, opt-in required to enable).
  CI: Drop Python version 3.7 from matrix.

2025.1 (2025-01-07): Feature: Signal readiness via sd_notify if NOTIFY_SOCKET environment variable is set.
  This benefits NixOS and other platforms using systemd. Suggested by Elias Probst.
  Build: Change to a more typical directory structure.
  CI: Drop Python version 3.8 from matrix, add version 3.13.

2025.1.1 (2025-01-13): Build: Exclude unnecessary files.

2026.0 (2026-02-12): Fix: Leave the assignment of IDs during database seeding to the SQLAlchemy library.
  This shifts certain responsibilities related to session state away from automx2, and addresses seeding
  problems when using non-SQLite databases.

2026.1 (2026-02-27): Feature: Support LDAP servers in JSON-based seeding.
