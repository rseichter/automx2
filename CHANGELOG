2019.0 (2019-12-13): First public release.

2020.0 (2020-01-24): Introduce LDAP support to map email addresses to login IDs.

2020.1 (2020-03-08): Support "werkzeug" release 1.0.0.

2020.2 (2020-12-16): Introduce support for POP3 servers.

2021.0 (2021-01-09): Improve handling of login name placeholders in Outlook generator.

2021.1 (2021-02-23): Fix LDAP attribute processing when using Active Directory backends.

2021.2 (2021-03-07): Change XML root element namespace in Outlook generator.

2021.3.1 (2021-04-02): Support additional mixed-case route in Outlook generator. Support CalDAV/CardDAV for eM Client.

2021.4 (2021-04-20): Bugfix: "SSL" element now depends on socket_type DB column. Drop "AuthRequired" XML element from
  Autodiscover response because automx2 always returned "on", which is the default value if the element is absent.

2021.5 (2021-10-04): Existing versions auf automx2 return "do not use SSL" for socket types other than SSL and STARTTLS.
  This previously undocumented behaviour can cause unexpected results. Future automx2 versions will terminate automx2
  when encountering invalid socket type strings in the database. The current release logs an error to notify users of
  the upcoming change.
  This release also improves the Mobileconfig generator, making it smarter when choosing among multiple servers defined
  in the database.

2021.6 (2021-12-17): Introduce "Encryption" element (see MS-OXDSCLI v20210817) in Autodiscover generator to better
  support server connections which require the use of STARTTLS.

2022.0 (2022-03-31): Simplified database initialisation is now possible via HTTP POST and a JSON payload.

2022.1 (2022-05-20): Request content type verification now works if additional parameters like "charset" are passed.

2022.2 (2022-06-03): Add support for mobileconfig signing.
