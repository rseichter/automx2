== How does automx2 work?

automx2 is a web service.
It is usually located behind a web server like NGINX and waits for configuration requests.
When a mail user agent (MUA), a.k.a. mail client, requests configuration it contacts the web server.
The web server then acts as a proxy and forwards all requests to automx2 and passes answers back to the MUA.
